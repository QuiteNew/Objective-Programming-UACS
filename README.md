# Objective-Programming-UACS

This course will teach you the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) using the C++ programming language. You will learn the concepts of Object Oriented Programming, such as: objects, abstraction, classes, hierarchy modularity and encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and operator overloading, through C++ programming exercises. By taking this course you will also:
Understand the concepts of object-oriented programming
Understand encapsulation
Understand extensibility
Understand software reusability Understand how to use class libraries Write in-line functions
Use reference parameters
Perform dynamic memory allocation with new and delete
Use default function arguments
Build abstract data types using classes
Understand and use constructor and destructor functions to initialize and destroy class objects
Use the const qualifier to create constant objects and constant member functions
Create static data members and static member functions
Use friend functions and friend classes
Overload functions
Overload operators to work with user-defined classes
Use inheritance to build class hierarchies
Understand and use polymorphism and virtual functions
Learning objectives
After completion of this course, the student will be able to:
- Demonstrate use of advanced programming statements and be able to use these statements in writing a large program.
- Demonstrate knowledge of data abstraction, specification, refinement and implementation.
- Demonstrate use of OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
- To get familiar with elements of OOP using C++.
- Acquiring the philosophy necessary for satisfying programming needs of other people, critical thinking and cooperation.
